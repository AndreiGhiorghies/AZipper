# AZipper

AZipper is a desktop application for Windows, written in C++, that allows compression and decompression of files and folders using a technique similar to Deflate. The project provides a graphical interface built with SDL2 and ImGui, enabling users to manage custom `.azip` archives. With this application, users can create, edit, and explore archives, having full control over their contents, offering a compresion ratio close to that of standard ZIP files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Main Features
- **Compress files and folders** into .azip format
- **Selective decompression** ‚Äì choose which files or folders to decompress
- **Insert, delete, and move files** directly within the archive
- **View archive structure** ‚Äì navigate folders and files
- **Progress bar** for all operations performed in the application
- **Intuitive graphical interface** with drag & drop and multi-selection
- **Open files** directly from the archive
- **Archive corruption detection**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithms Used (Backend)
### LZ77
- Lossless compression algorithm, identifies repetitive sequences and encodes them efficiently.
- Uses search and lookahead buffers for space optimization and fast data processing.
- Converts the entire file into sequences (length, offset, character) as follows:
    - If there is no sequence of at least 3 identical characters in the already processed data starting at the current position, the current character is saved as **(0, 0, character)**
    - If such a sequence exists in the already processed data, it is saved as a triplet **(length, offset, '-')**, where length is the sequence length and offset is the distance to the match; the '-' character has no significance
- The maximum valid sequence length is **258** and the maximum offset is **32768**, these values being relevant for efficient Huffman encoding using extra bytes
- Tokens are saved in a file so they do not need to be reconstructed when saving the file using Huffman codes
- For each length, the frequency of the code associated with that length is saved (see table below) together with the frequency of each character in a single frequency table, and for each offset, the frequency of the code associated with that offset is saved (see table below)

> For lengths and offsets, the Huffman code determines the interval, and extra bytes complete the exact value. Literals (0-255) have no extra bytes, and end-of-block (256) marks the end of a data block.

### Huffman & Canonical Huffman
- Creates short binary codes for frequent data, reducing file size.
- Canonical coding allows fast and reconstructible decoding.
- For each frequency table, a Huffman tree is generated from which the Huffman code length for each code associated with that literal/length and offset is extracted
- Using that length, a Canonical Huffman code is created for each code associated with that literal/length and offset, which will be used in file encoding
- Canonical Huffman codes are used instead of basic ones to save only the code length for each literal/length and offset, not the entire code, resulting in fewer bytes written to the compressed file and correct data decompression
- Each token is read from the temporary file and processed as follows:
    - If the token represents a single character, i.e. (0, 0, character), the Canonical Huffman code associated with that character is saved in the compressed file and the next token is processed
    - If the token is of the form (length, offset, character), the Canonical Huffman code associated with that length + the extra bytes used for decompression (see table above) are saved, and then the offset is saved in the same way
- Each file encoding ends with the Canonical Huffman code of the special end-of-block character, which marks the end of the file encoding

### `.azip` Archive Structure
- For each file to be compressed in the archive, the length of the file/folder name is saved, the name itself using ASCII codes, and then a bit representing whether the name is a file or folder (0 for folder and 1 for file). For each folder, its name is saved, then all file names in that folder, and then exiting the folder is marked by a file name length of 0
- After all file/folder names are written, for each file:
    - the number of Canonical Huffman codes used for compressing literals/lengths is saved
    - for each literal/length, the code associated with each literal/length is written, then the Canonical Huffman code length
    - the same is done for offsets
    - for each LZ77 token, the associated codes + extra bytes are written where applicable, and at the end of each compressed file, the end-of-block code marks the end of the file
- All data is saved in MSB-to-LSB format

### The data compression and organization method is similar to that used in DEFLATE, which can be found [here](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1951)
